   <h1>About Us</h1>

   <p><em>Recipe Collector</em> was created after our family couldn't share all their recipes. Some family members got authentic originals, while others were left to take grainy photos or attempt photo copies that never turned out right. We plan to change recipe collecting, forever.
   </p>
	  
   <p>Recipe Collector is a service that collects and creates beautiful, quality bound books that keep your precious recipes safe. We use professional grade image recreation to correct any aging or damadge to the original recipes. Your recipes, and their secrects, are never shared with anyone.
